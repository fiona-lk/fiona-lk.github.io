### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 2 was a favorite of mine. For this activity, I used functions with math to make Julian days to calculate the number of days between two dates.
    This changed the way I thought about problems. Initially, I was confused about how to solve for a difference in days as you would have to account for years, months, and days. When I read it and realized we could solve it through Julian days instead of Gregorian, I was fascinated. It made me think of how many problems become much easier when you think outside the box.


* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was enjoyable to me as I learned how to use if statements and functions with parking rules to solve issues we see in real life in the form of parking signs. By using the program you could learn the parking availability based on the input street, day, and time. 
    It is always fun when coding, but you often canâ€™t see how it would affect your life outside, and this changed that. By coding parking rules in if statements, we were able to create a tool I could see myself using in the future.


* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 2 simplified RGB into a simple activity. I used the graphicsmagic library, RGB values, functions, and vectors to make vibrant and interesting gifs. 
    I really enjoyed learning about RGB and how, with code, I can make interesting and vibrant gifs. I look forward to using it more in the future and I am glad this lab taught me how easy and fun it can be.
